# UNIFIED DEV SYSTEM - CORE ARCHITECTURE

## 🧬 Neural Core Evolution
The system has transitioned from fragmented specialist chatbots to a **Unified Intelligence** model. This unification allows the model to draw connections between general development practices and specific security auditing requirements.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### 1. Unified Vector Store (FAISS)
- **Path**: `Advanced_RAG_Chatbot/vector_db/unified`
- **Model**: `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`
- **Content**: Merged dataset and security specifications.

### 2. Intelligent Routing
The system automatically determines the appropriate context for each query, ensuring that security-sensitive questions receive the necessary audit-level depth while general queries remain concise.

### 3. Performance Layer
- **Semantic Cache**: Reduces API latency for repeated queries.
- **Lazy Loading**: Chatbot instances are initialized only when needed to save resources.

## ⚖️ Legacy Integration
The MERN-based logic core remains accessible for specific legacy tasks, maintaining backward compatibility while the system evolves.
