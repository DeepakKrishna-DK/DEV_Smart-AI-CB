# DEV SYSTEM - Unified AI Intelligence Core

## 🚀 Overview
Welcome to the **Unified DEV System**, a next-generation AI platform that integrates high-performance RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) with legacy conversational logic. This system has been recently evolved to unify the separate "General" and "Security" chatbots into a single, high-confidence **Unified Neural Core**.

## 🧠 Key Features
- **Unified Intelligence**: A single vector database containing all knowledge nodes, providing deeper context and cross-domain reasoning.
- **Dual Engine Architecture**:
    - **Unified Neural Core**: Advanced RAG system powered by Groq and FAISS.
    - **Legacy Logic Core**: Stable MERN-based chatbot for traditional workflows.
- **High Performance**: Optimized for CPU with sub-second response times and semantic caching.
- **Secure by Design**: Built-in security context for auditing and threat analysis.

## 🛠️ System Components
- **Frontend**: Streamlit-powered Neural UI and React-based Legacy UI.
- **Backend (Python)**: FAISS Vector DB, LangChain, Groq API.
- **Backend (Node.js)**: Express.js server for legacy logic and Dialogflow integration.

## 📈 Recent Updates
- ✅ Unified General and Security vector collections.
- ✅ Optimized performance analytics dashboard.
- ✅ Streamlined PDF ingestion pipeline.
- ✅ Integrated Groq Llama-3-70B for superior reasoning.

## 🚦 Getting Started
1. Run the `unified_launcher.ps1` or `unified_launcher.bat` to boot all systems.
2. Access the **Neural UI** at `http://localhost:8501`.
3. Access the **Legacy API** at `http://localhost:5000`.
